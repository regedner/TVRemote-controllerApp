# TV Remote Application - controllerApp 

This is a TV remote control application designed to interact with a WebSocket-based server. Originally developed for an internal TV project, the application allows users to control a TV device via an Android app. The project has been modified for public release by removing company-specific assets, such as logos and branding.
